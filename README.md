With the rapid rise of messaging platforms like WhatsApp, communication has never been easier or faster. However, this convenience also opens the door to new threats. More and more users are falling victim to scams—phishing links, fake giveaways, mal-ware-laced attachments, and deceptive images—often shared right through simple chat messages. Recognizing this growing problem, our project Scam Guard aims to help users stay safe by detecting and warning them about potentially harmful content in their WhatsApp messages in real time. Scam Guard is a lightweight, non-intrusive Android application built to run smoothly on any device without needing root access or special permissions. It uses Android's Accessibility Service to monitor incoming messages through WhatsApp notifications. This allows us to identify and analyse messages as soon as they arrive, without actually reading or storing the content, thus keeping user privacy intact. we extract any links using regular expressions and submit them to the Vi-rusTotal API, a trusted threat intelligence platform that scans URLs against multiple an-tivirus engines to detect phishing or malware activity. For media files like images, we use OpenCV, a powerful open-source computer vision library, to identify visual scams. This includes things like fake documents, embedded QR codes, or images with misleading prompts. These image scans help detect scams that go beyond just text, making Scam Guard more versatile and effective. Based on the results, Scam Guard classifies each message as Safe, Suspicious, or Harmful. If a message is suspicious or harmful, the app immediately alerts the user through a clear and actionable notification. Users can then choose to block the sender, report the message, or dismiss the alert if they think it's a false positive. This is all handled through Android’s Notification Manager and Broadcast Receivers, ensuring a smooth and responsive user experience. The overall goal of Scam Guard is to create a practical and user-friendly tool that adds an extra layer of protec-tion without interfering with how people use their phones. It’s designed for everyday users—no tech skills required.
